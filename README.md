# Obsidian Status Bar Organizer
## Abstract
This plugin enables you to easily reorder elements of the status bar, as well as choose which to hide or show.

## Usage
Once installed, simply enable the plugin and head to the "Status Bar Organizer" settings page.

You'll see an entry per each element of the status bar.
Using the handle on the left side, you can drag and drop to change the order.
Using the eye on the right side, you can toggle visibility of the elemente.

The changes you make will persist, even after restarting Obsidian.

## Deleting Plugins
If you delete some plugin which has a status bar element, its position will be remembered and will still be displayed on the settings page.
You can, however, simply click on the trash can symbol (where the visibility toggle previously was) to delete that entry.
